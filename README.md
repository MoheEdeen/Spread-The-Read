# Spread the Read

## Project Overview

**Spread the Read** is a web application designed to assist users in determining the appropriate grade level for a piece of text. This is particularly useful for educators who need to ensure their materials are suitable for their students' reading levels. The application employs advanced AI techniques, supplemented by traditional readability algorithms, to provide accurate and reliable grade level assessments.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Readability Analysis**: The core feature of Spread the Read is its AI-based readability analysis. The AI model leverages data from previously assessed texts to determine the grade level of new texts. This approach ensures more accurate and context-aware evaluations.

- **Backup Readability Algorithms**: In cases where the AI model cannot confidently assess a text, the application falls back on established readability algorithms, including:
  - Automated Readability Index
  - Gunning Fog Index
  - Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease
  - Coleman-Liau Index

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following:

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Vue JS

- **Backend**:
  - Python (Flask)

- **Database**:
  - MySQL

- **Template Engine**:
  - Django

By combining the power of AI with traditional readability algorithms, Spread the Read provides a comprehensive solution for educators seeking to tailor their materials to appropriate reading levels. With a solid technology foundation and user-centric design, this application stands as a valuable tool in the educational domain.
